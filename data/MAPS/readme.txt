MAPS - MIDI Aligned Piano Sounds

Version 0.5

MAPS is a piano sound data base for multi-F0 estimation and automatic transcription.

It is documented in my thesis (in French) and on my website soon (in English). You can cite these reference: "Multipitch estimation of piano sounds using a new probabilistic spectral smoothness principle, V. Emiya, R. Badeau, B. David, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, (to be published)" (English reference) or "Transcription automatique de la musique de piano, V. Emiya, PhD Thesis, Telecom ParisTech/ENST, 2008" (French reference).

Thanks for reporting any bugs. In particular, be aware of the following possible erroroneous files in the Disklavier recordings (ENSTDkCl/ENSTDkAm sub-bases):
- without bug, the annotation accuracy is about 10 ms, according to what I observed.
- some files may have the following bug: a large offset between the reference and the audio is introduced. This is the case for file MAPS_ISOL_NO_M_S1_M98_ENSTDkAm.wav for instance. This should not affect a lot of file, but I could not checked all of them.

This seems to be due to hardware issues, although I tried to control the synchronization of audio and MIDI thanks to a JAVA software (sequencer like Cubase seems to not allow this).

Thanks for any comments you may give me back about this database, either on some erroneous files or on whatever could improve the base. I hope to be able to release a final version (say 1.0) soon, bug free and documented in English...
